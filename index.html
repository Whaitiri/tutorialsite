		<p><img src="img/gengar_main.png"> Hello this website is about my favourite Pokemon Gengar. He is a Ghost/Poison type pokemon, and he is the fully evolved version of both Gastly and Haunter. He has extremely high speed and special attack, and this has earned him a reputation as an effective sweeper.</p>
